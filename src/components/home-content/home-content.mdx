# Who We Are

Southampton Robotics Outreach is a student society at the [University of Southampton](https://southampton.ac.uk), UK. Whilst we are primarily based in the [School of Electronics and Computer Science](https://ecs.soton.ac.uk), students and staff from other departments or even faculties can join us too. We have many active members from across the university including members from the School of Engineering, Faculty of Social Sciences and even the Professional Services, as well as ECS (of course).

We are a friendly bunch of people who typically meet once per week to discuss what's going on, any events we have planned and anything that needs doing that week, followed by a trip to a local pub to relax and unwind in good company. We're always welcoming new members who are free to show up at any of our meetings.

# What We Do

We run robotics events! Primarily, these are focused at getting young people (be that local primary or secondary school students, or even our own university students) involved in and excited about STEM, using robotics as a medium. Our events range from single-day (or even single-afternoon) practical sessions to multiple day or even week long robotics competitions with hundreds of attendees, participants and volunteers. We work closely with the department to run various summer schools, and also work closely with [Student Robotics](https://srobo.org), whose yearly event takes place at the University, in Building 42.
