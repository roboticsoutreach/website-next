The Society held the Annual General Meeting on the 15th May 2025. During the meeting, the President, Secretary, Treasurer and Marketing Officer presented a summary of the year from their perspective, and we also voted to amend the constitution to add the additional role of Hackathon Officer.

Most importantly, the new (2025/26) committee were elected.

**President:** Aaron Smith  
**Secretary:** India Bunce  
**Treasurer:** Stefan Merlas  
**Welfare Officer:** Indigo Nolan  
**Hackathon Officer:** Liam Soutter  
**Marketing Officer:** Aaron Smith

On behalf of the outgoing committee, I'd like to thank the society membership at large for an immensely successful year---we all look forward to what 2025/26 has to hold for Southampton Robotics Outreach.
