For quite some time (at least as long as I've been the society's Technical Officer), the roboticsoutreach.org website has been a fairly sad state of affairs. It's hosted somewhere still linked to a member from a long time ago(!), has not been updated visibly since the addition of the "Freshers 2021" nav-bar link (which is when I joined the university, and I graduate this year!) and in general is just pretty bloated.

For about the same length of time we've been saying that we want to do something about this. So, over the Easter holiday, I actually decided to do something about it (instead of doing my coursework). You're looking at it!

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) is a fun Facebook Open-Source project which aims to make building simple websites that are a mix of documentation, static content and blogs easy, while still allowing the developer modern conveniences such as React (which I am not that personally a fan of, but is undeniably popular among web developers) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com), which is also somewhat cool.

We use this stack, the docs and blog plugins, and bundle it all up and run it on CloudFlare Pages.

This post *really* exists so I can demonstrate to my colleagues the blog functionality!
