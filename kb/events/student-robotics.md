[Student Robotics](sr) is an event organised by an external charity (of the same name), but with many of our members volunteering. Indeed, the charity was formed by ex-SRO members (although the history is rather more complicated).

It follows a similar format to the [summer school](/kb/events/summer-school/index.md) but the schools that parcicipate get their kit several months before the event, and then only show up in Southampton for the final competition, usually held over a weekend in Easter.
