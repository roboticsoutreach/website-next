# RoboHack

RoboHack is an event for university students which follows a similar format to the [summer school](/kb/events/summer-school.md), taking place over only one 24-hour period (or thereabouts).

## Design Studio Era (2024)

The first RoboHack event took place in May 2024, in the Boldrewood Campus Design Studio. Whilst a flexible space, this presented various issues in terms of getting the right equipment (much of which weighs a lot) to Boldrewood in time for the event (made worse by the fact that we can't store anything there). Less than ideal planning also led to the majority of the event setup happening over a short period in the evening immediately before the event.

In 2024, Ooznest sponsored the event and sent us a whole bunch of aluminium extrusion and accessories, which we still use. ECS paid for the rest of the event.

Overall the event was a moderate success, but we did vow never to do it in the design studio again.

## SUSU Era (2025-present)

More recent RoboHack events have taken place in SUSU, Building 42. This is much easier from a logistics standpoint by virtue of being on the same campus as SRO equipment, and indeed in the same building as most of the technical equipment. The budget for the event in 2025 came entirely from ECS, and was slightly more than 2024 as we increased the production value significantly.
