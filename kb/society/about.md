# About SRO

Southampton Robotics Outreach (abbr. SRO) is a society at the [University of Southampton][uos] that aims to get young people involved in STEM through the medium of robotics.

## What do we do?

According to our constitution, our main objectives are:

- To share our excitement about engineering with others
- To introduce younger people to the range of activities involved in an engineering project including:
    - Teamwork
    - Planning
    - Technical Design
    - Technical Build
    - Testing
- To use the medium of robotics to inspire the next generation to take their involvement with engineeringto the next level
- To develop our own project management and technical engineering experience by leading others

## What do we **really** do?

So the rather bland descriptions above essentially boil down into the following activities:

- Running a bunch of [events](/kb/events/index.md) to get people involved in robotics.
- Developing software and hardware to support them.
- Going to the pub, and other social activities.
