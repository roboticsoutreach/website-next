# Society Membership

Any member of the Students' Union (full or associate) may join the society. Membership is entirely free and lasts for the entire academic year. Joining the society proper is important, as you're covered by the group insurance policy held by the Students' Union, can submit reimbursement claims against the society, will receive (infrequent but usually important) emails from the society, and (arguably most importantly!) prove to the Students' Union that we are worth keeping affiliated!

Joining the society is done via the [SUSU group page for SRO](https://susu.org/student-robotics-southampton).

Only one type of membership is available and this grants equal privileges to the holder to any other member - regardless of whether the member is a student (full SU member) or staff/alumni (associate SU member). The only exception is that only full members (current students) may run for a position on the committee.
