# Meetings

The society meets once a week during university term time. In 2025, this is on Thursday evenings. Our meetings start at 18:00.

We meet in Building 32, room 4073 (Mary Campbell Room). This room has to be booked in advance by the society secretary, and the booking must be approved by ECS administrative staff. Undergraduate and non-ECS ID cards will not grant access; a member must either be a member of ECS staff, or must have their card programmed so it can access the room.

There is no access to building 32 after 18:00 or on weekends for non-ECS members. If you require access to the building, please make your way to the north entrance (closest to buildings 1 and 16) and get in touch with the society via Discord.
