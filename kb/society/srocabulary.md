# *SRO*cabulary

SROcabulary is an in-joke at the society in which we take common words and either prepend them with, or replace the first syllable with, *sr-*.

Examples include the srub (pub), the srinibus (minibus), sriscord (Discord), srommittee (committee) and the srocabulary itself (the original word is left as an exercise for the reader).
