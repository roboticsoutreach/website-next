# Access and ID Cards

We work mainly in the evenings, and building 32 (where we mainly work) reverts to card access only outside working hours. All ECS members are able to gain access through the main entrance doors until 11pm. No interior doors, however, are accessible unless the cardholder is staff or a PGR in ECS.

It is usually possible to get the ID cards of the committee programmed so they can access readers in the "All ECS Readers (B32)" reader group. Note that the room 32/4073 is not included in this group and must be added separately.

If a non-ECS member is expected to arrive after 18:00, then a member of the society should arrange to meet them at the north entrance.

## Keys

The society has a set of keys which give us access to the B32 cupboards, the chair store on L4 of B53, and the two cupboards in the B53 L4 breakout space.

The key to the rightmost B32 cupboard is held in the adjacent lockbox. The rest of the keys are on hooks inside the right cupboards's door.
