# Places

We have a number of storage locations and places we usually go around the university.

:::warning
No public right of access exists within university buildings, including B53 and B32. If you are external to the university and helping us with an event, please try to avoid moving alone around these buildings. Do not try to gain access to locked buildings unless you are in possession of your own valid university ID card which grants access, or in exceptional circumstances, a generic "Door Entry" card which grants access (issued usually for certain events).

## Building 32

### Level 3

32/3093 contains three cupboards. The two cupboards to the right belong to SRO.

### Level 4

32/4073 is the current (2025) meeting room.

## Building 53

### Breakout Space

The breakout space 53/4029 contains two cupboards (one wooden, one grey metallic) which belong to SRO.

### Seminar Room

The seminar room 53/4025 contains two table stores (on the wall that adjoins to the corridor). The rightmost table store (as you are looking at them) contains the SRO wood supply. It is usually never locked; if it ever does become locked, we're stuffed, as we do not have a key.
